# Tests

There is a lot of comments in this code because I've never actually wrote tests for a project before (lol).  I'm still learning how they work and the best practice standard for how they should be ordered, and what xyz attribute means. 

These are extremely ugly I fear, any recommendations is appreciated - especially when it comes to things like file arrangement or naming conventions. 

Pls bare that in mind while looking into this code.
